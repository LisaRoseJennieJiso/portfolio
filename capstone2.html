    <h1>BCC Students Events Attendance Monitoring System with Face Recognition via Android Application</h1>
    <p>There are problems occurring when the attendance is taken manually such as: Data manipulation, as the data is traditionally recorded, it can be easily exploited. The students may manipulate information to claim that they have been in the event. Moreover, this can create a “Time Theft” condition as well. As such, you will give plus points to the students for the day or time that they did not even attend. Second is the possible human errors, the attendance of the students that need to be compiled, keeping in mind the necessary compliance, remuneration, etc. However, when such tasks are done manually, the chances of human error get elevated. Third is the accuracy of the attendance taken manually, you may receive false attendance data from the students. The attendance sheet may be tampered with to add other students' names even though they are not in the said event. Recording attendance manually is very time-consuming. This can affect productivity as well as the performance of the students. Besides, it will also take your time to obtain the attendance data of all your students. Furthermore, the entire process may even end up consuming a lot of your time in maintaining an organized sheet, rectifying errors related to time entry, among others. However, in the case of automated attendance monitoring system, you will be able to do all such tasks in just one click.
        This system has made it a lot easier to manage the attendance of the students in school events, especially if it is outside of school premises. Apart from recording the attendance, it can prevent students from utilizing the data since it has various functions that can track the user's location and verify their identity easily. An automated attendance tool relieves you of the stress of such errors and miscalculations.</p>
